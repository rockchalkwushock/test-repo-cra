# test-repo-cra

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository was for testing the compatibility of the `cloudinary-react` library with CRA. This repository is refrenced in the [test-repo](https://github.com/rockchalkwushock/test-repo) _README.md_. The repository will be deleted after the issue between Next.js & the `cloudinary-react` library can be resolved.

FYI the library functions fine within the CRA ecosystem.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
